Raw Data
--------

The measurements involve the use of smartphones to gather several measurements like acceleration and magnitude 
during activities of several subjects. The files given in a large zip file have one lookup datafile with
each king of activity and its corresponding id, the types of measurements and their corresponding id,
and finally test and train data, with measurements for the subjects and the activities (subjects and activities
in different file).

The zip file can be found here: - [source](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

All the kinds of measurements are 561 and too much to include them here. They are available in the file
**features.txt** which is included in the above zip file.
